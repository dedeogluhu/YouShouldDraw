## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Runs the Expressjs server
```
yarn serve
```

### Runs the vue dev server
```
yarn client
```
### Note : As the vue server and the express server uses the same port you need to adjust the settings or run the express one first and vue server later

### The project actually has 2 views inside the client folder. In the static and views folder was the first try i made with vanilla Javascript. The ExpressJs server is connected to that. I will probably delete these folders and continue with VueJs.
